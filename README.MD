Most peopleuse pulseIn() to read pwmsignals from a receiver. But a call to pulseIn() could take 20 milliseconds. This is because pulseIn() waits for the pin to go from digital LOW to HIGH and back to LOW again. If youâ€™ve got multiple channels, 5 for example, it could take up to 100 milliseconds just to read from the receiver. For most intents and purposes this is far too slow.

Therefore I use hardware interruptsto read the PWM signals. 
With Arduino, hardware interrupts can be generated by a pin changing value, going LOW, going HIGH, rising or falling. The processor responds to interrupts by suspending its current activity and handling the interrupt with an interrupt handler function. After the interrupt handler has returned, the processor resumes its previous activity.

Unlike the easy way, reading PWM inputs with interrupts allows the processor to continue with other tasks except for that very brief moment when an interrupt is handled. With this method the light secuences seem to be running continuisly in stead of pausing every time for 20 milliseconds per receiver channel that is used.

To read PWM inputs we must know when a pin goes HIGH and LOW, and so we are only really interested in CHANGE interrupts. When a PWM pin goes HIGH, a timer is started. When the pin goes LOW, we can measure the pulse time by checking how much time has passed.
